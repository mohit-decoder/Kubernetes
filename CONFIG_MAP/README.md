#   ConfigMap in Kubernetes

**Overview**
In Kubernetes, a ConfigMap is an API object used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs. This allows you to decouple configuration artifacts from container images, making your applications more portable and easier to configure.

**What is ConfigMap?**
A ConfigMap allows you to define configuration data in a Kubernetes-native way. It is a way to inject configuration data into your applications running in Pods, without having to rebuild your container images.

**Use Cases:**
- *Application Configuration:* Store application settings like database URLs, feature flags, and environment-specific parameters.
- *Configuration Separation:* Keep configuration separate from your container images to adhere to the Twelve-Factor App principles.
- *Dynamic Configuration:* Update configuration data without restarting your Pods.

**How It is Useful in Deployments:**
- Flexibility: Decouple configuration from application code, enabling different configurations for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
- Consistency: Centralize configuration management, making it easier to maintain consistency across multiple instances of applications.
- Ease of Update: Update configuration values without redeploying applications, which simplifies the deployment process.
